/**
*	In terms of the main section – a few thoughts:
*/
they could be independently chosen,
create a widget that you can choose independently what is going to be presented there.
Then below this, the full width ‘all items’/’all posts’ section. These look good but if possible it would be good to truncate them a bit too, to maximise the content visible on the front page.
[*]Recent posts / top posts on sidebar – all good
**[]Somewhere in the sidebar or homepage we need an ebulletin sign-up link (which would just be a mailto as on the current site).**
[*]The sidebar twitter feed should be @LVSCnews. Limit it to 3 or 5 tweet so it’s not too huge.
**[]Search didn’t work for me – but I’m sure you’ll straighten that out. It’s really important function.**
[*]By the way, we don’t need to include partner loos –g BTEG, Rocket Science, etc – as I’d previously included

[*]	The Header isn’t working for me as it is. You are welcome to ‘uncouple’ the Mayor/ESF logo from the VCS Assist part, and
[*]	make the ‘VCS Assist’ part bigger.
[*]	I think get rid of the icons/circles and use the space to place the funder logos instead. But use the ‘Support for VCS employment and skills…” tag line. 
	In terms of logos, we need: 
	[*]	Mayor/ESF;
	[*]	Trust for London;
	[*]	and pretty soon we’ll need to add the Big Lottery Fund logo too (which is circular – attached) so we’ll need all that space. Alternately they could go in the sidebar or footer, as previously discussed. Annoyingly ESF logo needs to be big enough that the tiny little text is readable.

[*]	All the logos need to be on a white background (sorry!) so if there’s a way for the header (or footer/sidebar) to be white, but still differentiated from the main section, that’d be great.

[*]	We’ll also need the new LVSC/UWL logo somewhere – maybe in a sidebar if it’s a bit crowded in the header.
[*]tag cloud under top posts
[*]	The headlines are coming through incomplete – that’s a concern! Bear in mind despite my best efforts the headlines tend to be quite long I think three across would be a bit more readable (on a desktop). 
[*]Possibly a three by three grid with – 4x sticky posts, 2x posts tagged as ‘events’; 1x post tagged ‘vacancy’; 1x post tagged ‘research’; 1x post tagged ‘funding opp’? With little headings that were also links to the category page (http://vcsassist.org.uk/category/news/ or whatever) – that’d be great.
[*]grid of 3 x 3
